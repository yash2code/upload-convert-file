We can use serverless deployment method.

Why?
Serverless computing offers a number of advantages over traditional cloud-based or server-centric infrastructure. For many developers, serverless architectures offer greater scalability, more flexibility, and quicker time to release, all at a reduced cost. With serverless architectures, developers do not need to worry about purchasing, provisioning, and managing backend servers. However, serverless computing is not a magic bullet for all web application developers.

Advantages:
 - No server management is necessary
 - Developers are only charged for the server space they use, reducing cost
 - Serverless architectures are inherently scalable
 - Quick deployments and updates are possible
 - Code can run closer to the end user, decreasing latency
